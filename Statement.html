    <div id="content"><h2>Perfecting Imperfection</h2>
<p id="content2"> Perfect has been defined as balanced, proportioned, calm, predictable, orderly, and most of all - controlled. But perfection does not lie only in the regular, the symmetrical, the orderly, the logical, or the measurable. The irregular, the irrational, the illogical, the spontaneous, and the whimsical are the province of the arts and there is as much basis for truth in the irrational as there is in the rational.
​<br><br>
A work of art is the sum of its parts. That sum may include irregularities that give charm and delight as a result of surprise. The line between the perfect and the imperfect is a matter of taste – the ultimate artistic asset and indefinable trait. It's the imperfect qualities that contribute to the altogether integrity of the piece. The “art” is finding where the line is drawn between an acceptable imperfect mark and an unacceptable mistake.
<br><br>
Imperfection means variation and variability. I find that the slightest fluctuation in form holds the most character. It's through variation that the hands behind the creation of the piece are revealed. The knowledge that human hands put in the effort to construct a specific work, can invoke a special feeling in the consumer that otherwise wouldn't be felt with a perfectly manufactured piece.
<br><br>
Therefore, as an artist I strive to deviate away from manufactured perfection. I allow for abnormalities and subtle imperfections in the composition of my pieces, while still aspiring to create graceful, delicate, aesthetically pleasing designs.</p>
