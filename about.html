        <p id="content"> Mariana Squatrito is a ceramic artist interested in the complexities of human choice and the imperfect qualities of life. Mariana received her Bachelors of Fine Art from San Jose State University, where she focused her efforts in ceramics and metal sculpture. Through functional pottery and non-functional sculpture, Mariana attempts to spark conversations about embracing imperfection.
          <br><br>
        In a recent gallery show, Goldilocks Complex, 100 unique mugs were crafted to stimulate a conversation about individualism and everyone’s idea of what’s “just right.” In another exhibition, The Stuff of Fairytales, Mariana exemplifies her observations of human nature through the installation of a bronze dandelion. The lighter-than-air dandelion carries our fantastic wishes. A wish is a fantasy and a hope. Mariana’s fascination with imperfect behavior, infinite variation, and unpredictability remains a constant thread from which she suspends her pieces. These suspended infinite and variable wishes are an emanation and resonate from her work.
